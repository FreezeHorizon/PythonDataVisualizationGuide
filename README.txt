========================================
Python Data Science Environment Setup
========================================

QUICK START:
------------
Windows Users: Run "AutoRun.bat" to automatically install and launch everything
Linux/Mac Users: Run "./setup.sh" to automatically install and launch everything


WHAT GETS INSTALLED:
--------------------
- Python (if not already installed)
- Jupyter Notebook (Interactive Python IDE)
- pandas (Data manipulation and analysis)
- seaborn (Statistical data visualization)
- matplotlib (Plotting library - comes included with seaborn)


DOCUMENTATION LINKS:
--------------------

Jupyter Notebook Documentation:
https://docs.jupyter.org/en/latest/

Pandas Documentation:
https://pandas.pydata.org/docs/

Seaborn Documentation & Tutorial:
https://seaborn.pydata.org/tutorial.html

Matplotlib Documentation:
https://matplotlib.org/stable/index.html

Python Official Documentation:
https://docs.python.org/3/

Note: Seaborn includes matplotlib as a dependency, so matplotlib will be 
automatically installed when you install seaborn. However, it's useful to 
know both libraries since seaborn is built on top of matplotlib and you 
may need matplotlib's documentation for advanced customization.

For working with DataFrames and data manipulation, refer to the Pandas 
documentation above. For importing additional Python libraries or modules, 
refer to the Python official documentation.


MANUAL INSTALLATION (if needed):
---------------------------------
If the automated scripts don't work, you can install manually:

1. Download and install Python from: https://www.python.org/downloads/
2. Open command prompt/terminal and run:
   pip install jupyter notebook
   pip install pandas
   pip install seaborn


GETTING STARTED:
----------------
1. Run the AutoRun script (AutoRun.bat for Windows, setup.sh for Linux/Mac)
2. Jupyter Notebook will open in your default web browser
3. Create a new notebook by clicking "New" > "Python 3"
4. Try the sample files included:
   - student.csv - Sample student data for practice
   - student_analysis.py - Example script showing how to analyze the data
5. Start coding!


TROUBLESHOOTING:
----------------
- If scripts fail, try running them as administrator (Windows) or with sudo (Linux/Mac)
- Make sure you have an internet connection for downloading packages
- If Jupyter doesn't open automatically, manually run: jupyter notebook


SUPPORT:
--------
For issues with the tools themselves, refer to their official documentation above.
