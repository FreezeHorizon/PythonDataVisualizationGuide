========================================
Python Data Science Environment Setup
========================================

QUICK START:
------------
Windows Users: Run or Double click "AutoRun.bat" to automatically install and launch everything
Linux/Mac Users: Run "./AutoRunLinux.sh" to automatically install and launch everything


WHAT GETS INSTALLED:
--------------------
- Python (if not already installed)
- Jupyter Notebook (Interactive Python IDE)
- pandas (Data manipulation and analysis)
- seaborn (Statistical data visualization)
- matplotlib (Plotting library - comes included with seaborn)


DOCUMENTATION LINKS:
--------------------

Jupyter Notebook Documentation:
https://docs.jupyter.org/en/latest/

Seaborn Documentation & Tutorial:
https://seaborn.pydata.org/tutorial.html

Matplotlib Documentation:
https://matplotlib.org/stable/index.html

Note: Seaborn includes matplotlib as a dependency, so matplotlib will be 
automatically installed when you install seaborn. However, it's useful to 
know both libraries since seaborn is built on top of matplotlib and you 
may need matplotlib's documentation for advanced customization.


MANUAL INSTALLATION (if needed):
---------------------------------
If the automated scripts don't work, you can install manually:

1. Download and install Python from: https://www.python.org/downloads/
2. Open command prompt/terminal and run:
   pip install jupyter notebook
   pip install pandas
   pip install seaborn


GETTING STARTED:
----------------
1. Run the AutoRun script (AutoRun.bat for Windows, AutoRunLinux.sh for Linux/Mac)
2. Jupyter Notebook will open in your default web browser
3. Create a new notebook by clicking "New" > "Python 3"
4. Start coding!


TROUBLESHOOTING:
----------------
- If scripts fail, try running them as administrator (Windows) or with sudo (Linux/Mac)
- Make sure you have an internet connection for downloading packages
- If Jupyter doesn't open automatically, manually run: jupyter notebook


SUPPORT:
--------
For issues with the tools themselves, refer to their official documentation above.
